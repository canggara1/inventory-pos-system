Installation Guide for Local Setup of Inventory and POS System

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- pip package manager installed
- Git installed (optional, for cloning repository)
- SQLite3 (comes bundled with Python)

Steps:

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   - The app uses SQLite by default.
   - The database file `pos_system.db` will be created automatically on first run.
   - Alternatively, you can manually create the database by running:
     ```
     python
     >>> from backend.app import create_app, db
     >>> app = create_app()
     >>> app.app_context().push()
     >>> db.create_all()
     >>> exit()
     ```

5. Run the backend Flask server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```
   - The server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.

6. Serve the frontend files:
   - In the project root directory, run:
     ```
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Access the frontend at http://localhost:8000/index.html

7. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
   - Use the login page to authenticate and access the dashboard.

Notes:
- Ensure ports 5000 and 8000 are free before starting servers.
- For development, keep the backend server running in one terminal and the frontend server in another.
- To stop servers, use Ctrl+C in the terminal.

Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter module import errors, ensure you are running commands from the correct directory and have activated the virtual environment.
- If the database does not initialize, check for permission issues or existing database files.
- For any package installation issues, try upgrading pip:
  ```
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

This guide should help you set up and run the Inventory and POS system locally for development and testing.
