Friendly Installation Guide for Inventory and POS System (No Programming Needed)

What You Need:
- A Windows computer
- Internet connection to download software
- Basic computer skills (like opening programs and typing commands)

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Download and Install Python:
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click "Download Python" for Windows
   - Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" before clicking Install

2. Download the Project Files:
   - If you have a link to the project ZIP file, download and unzip it to a folder you can find easily (like Desktop)
   - Or ask someone to help you get the project files into a folder

3. Open Command Prompt:
   - Press Windows key, type "cmd", and open Command Prompt

4. Navigate to the Project Folder:
   - In Command Prompt, type:
     ```
     cd path\to\project\backend
     ```
     Replace `path\to\project` with the actual folder path where you unzipped the files

5. Install Required Software:
   - Type this command and press Enter:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Wait for the installation to finish

6. Start the Backend Server:
   - In the same Command Prompt window, type:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```
   - You should see messages indicating the server is running on http://localhost:5000

7. Open Another Command Prompt Window:
   - Press Windows key, type "cmd", and open a new Command Prompt

8. Navigate to the Project Root Folder:
   - Type:
     ```
     cd path\to\project
     ```
     Replace with your actual project folder path

9. Start the Frontend Server:
   - Type:
     ```
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - This will serve the frontend files on http://localhost:8000

10. Open Your Web Browser:
    - Go to http://localhost:8000/index.html
    - You should see the login page of the Inventory & POS system

11. Login and Use the App:
    - Use the credentials provided or ask your administrator
    - Explore the dashboard, inventory, transfers, POS, and reports

Additional Details for Frontend Server:

- When starting the frontend server, make sure you are in the directory that contains the HTML files such as index.html.
- For example, if your project folder is located at:
  C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\inventory-pos-system-main
- Open Command Prompt and navigate to this directory:
  ```
  cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\inventory-pos-system-main
  ```
- Then start the frontend server with:
  ```
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
- This will serve the frontend files correctly and avoid 404 errors.

Tips:
- Keep both Command Prompt windows open while using the app
- To stop servers, press Ctrl+C in each Command Prompt window
- If you get errors, double-check the folder paths and that Python is installed correctly
